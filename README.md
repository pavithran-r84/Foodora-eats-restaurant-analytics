## Problem Statement
Foodora Eats operates across multiple cities and cuisines. Despite high platform activity, customer satisfaction varies significantly across locations and food categories. This analysis aims to identify patterns and inconsistencies that impact customer experience and platform engagement.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains restaurant-level information including city, locality, cuisines, ratings, votes, and delivery availability.

Data preparation included handling missing values, retaining only relevant attributes, and making deliberate assumptions to ensure analytical clarity.

## Analysis Approach
- Descriptive and diagnostic analytics,  
- City-level and locality-level performance analysis, 
- Cuisine popularity vs customer satisfaction analysis, and 
- Delivery availability impact on ratings. 

The analysis was conducted primarily using Excel for data preparation and Power BI for visual storytelling.
